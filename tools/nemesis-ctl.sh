Helper script to manage development and production services.

Usage: $0 <action> <environment> [options]

Actions:
  start           Build (optional) and start services in the background.
  stop            Stop and remove services (containers and networks).
  clean           Stop and remove services AND delete associated data volumes.

Environments:
  dev             Development environment.
  prod            Production environment.

Options:
  --build         Build images before starting (not for 'stop' or 'clean' actions).
  --monitoring    Enable the monitoring profile (Grafana, Prometheus).
  --jupyter       Enable the Jupyter profile.
  --llm           Enable the LLM services profile.

Examples:
  # Start production services with monitoring
  $0 start prod --monitoring

  # Stop all production services that were started with the monitoring profile
  $0 stop prod --monitoring

  # Stop services and remove all associated data volumes for the dev environment
  $0 clean dev

  # Build and start all development services
  $0 start dev --build
