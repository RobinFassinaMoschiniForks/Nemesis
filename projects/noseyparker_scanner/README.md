## Overview

This service integrates Nosey Parker for secret scanning with:
- **Dapr** for pub/sub messaging
- **MinIO** for object storage

The workflow is:

1. Service listens for events on a pub/sub topic
2. When a message arrives, it downloads the specified file from MinIO
3. The file is scanned for secrets using Nosey Parker
4. Results are published to an output topic
