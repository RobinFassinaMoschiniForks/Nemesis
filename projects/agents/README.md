# Agents Service

TODO

## Purpose

This service contains a number of agents used by Nemesis (if configured) to achieve a number of tasks, including triaging alerts.

This service automatically triages security findings generated by the platform, classifying them as true positives, false positives, or requiring manual review. It helps security analysts prioritize their investigation efforts by reducing false positives and highlighting genuine threats.
